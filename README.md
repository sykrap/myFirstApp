# MyFirstApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.4.

This is a learning exercise to learn Angular CLI, Node and Materialize.

Also, learned how to do conditional logic, components and Git Hub commit. 
Set up
1. Visual studio code (software that runs, to look at html and css in different colors, text editors that is better than notepad)
2. Git Bash (software that runs, command prompt that allows pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, touch)
3. Node js (software you download to your system, you get NPM installed with node)
4. Angular Cli: command line interface)
5. Create Git Hub account and profile and a project

Functionality
1. conditional logic
- create a variable
- define the type of the variable (boolean, number etc)
- set the variable to (this.(variable name) = !this.(variable name))
2. ordered list, unordered list, headers, paragraph, link (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/)
3. giving the text color, margins, using class to make one paragraph bigger than the other one.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
